# Collection of Radianite boards
This is a repository to showcase all of our work onto making Radianite boards. All here are open and licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0

# Contributing
You will need:
- KiCad 8.0+ (7.0 is okay, but don't install 6.0, 8.0 doesn't support legacy zone filling strategy)
- Git
## Steps
1. Fork and clone this repository into your account
```
https://github.com/<username>/RadianiteBoards/
```
2. Open the `.kicad_pro` file on either project you want to help in.
3. Edit, edit, edit!
4. Commit with your changes. Make sure your commit messages are concise!
5. Finally, create a pull request. A member will look after your design. There are criterias taken into account:
   - Legibility and form factor
   - Trace lengths and signal integrity (advanced computers only like Project Lemon Irvine)
   - Overall impedance (including RF)
   - Possibility for EMI or crosstalks (<1% to be accepted, almost no EMI or crosstalks)
  
# Help with new board ideas
We don't just take our own ideas; in fact: we allow other people to get into Radianite and contribute to new board ideas. Make sure you:
  - have the necessary knowledge on that SoC/MCU
  - think it might be compatible
  - are ready to write some software for that board
  - get creative and have fun!

You don't need to say in words about the ideas; in fact: you can even design that circuit board first as a draft and let our team pick which one to get into Radianite! Make sure you:
  - maximize rounded corners (a radius of 3mm is ideal)
  - make the board aesthetically pleasing as possible
  - add fun elements like sentences, etc
After that, you might earn a shoutout in our mass-produced units.

We hope this revolutionizes how we, as engineers, delivers ideas and fixes in a very open manner. Thank you for choosing Radianite!
